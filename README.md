File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
Error Handling Lab üß™: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn‚Äôt exist or can‚Äôt be read.


```python
def modify_and_write_file(input_filename, output_filename):
  """Reads a file, modifies its content, and writes it to a new file.

  Args:
    input_filename: The name of the file to read.
    output_filename: The name of the file to write to.
  """
  try:
    with open(input_filename, 'r') as infile, open(output_filename, 'w') as outfile:
      content = infile.read()
      # Modify the content here (example: reverse the content)
      modified_content = content[::-1]
      outfile.write(modified_content)
    print(f"File '{input_filename}' modified and written to '{output_filename}'")
  except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File '{input_filename}' not found.")
  except PermissionError:
    print(f"Error: Permission denied to read '{input_filename}'.")
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Get the input filename from the user
input_filename = input("Enter the name of the file to read: ")
# Get the output filename from the user
output_filename = input("Enter the name of the file to write to: ")

# Call the function to modify and write the file
modify_and_write_file(input_filename, output_filename)
```

Explanation:

1. `modify_and_write_file` Function:
   - This function takes the input and output filenames as arguments.
   - It uses a `try...except` block to handle potential errors.
   - `with open(...) as ...`: This is a convenient way to open files, ensuring they are automatically closed even if errors occur.
     - `'r'` opens the input file for reading.
     - `'w'` opens the output file for writing (overwriting if it exists).
   - Reading the Content:
     - `content = infile.read()` reads the entire content of the input file into the `content` variable.
   - Modifying the Content:
     - `modified_content = content[::-1]` reverses the content. You can replace this with your own modification logic.
   - Writing the Modified Content:
     - `outfile.write(modified_content)` writes the modified content to the output file.
   - Error Handling:
     - `FileNotFoundError`: Raised if the input file doesn't exist.
     - `PermissionError`: Raised if the program doesn't have permission to read the input file.
     - `Exception`: Catches any other unexpected errors.

2. Getting Input from the User:
   - The program prompts the user to enter the input and output filenames.

3. Calling the Function:
   - `modify_and_write_file(input_filename, output_filename)` calls the function to perform the file modification and writing.

How to Run:

1. Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `file_modifier.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the script using `python file_modifier.py`.
5. The program will ask for the input and output filenames. Enter them accordingly.
